# Old-car-price-prediction-MLproject

Description:

This project focuses on predicting the selling prices of cars based on several features using the Linear Regression algorithm. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing information about various cars, including details like fuel type, seller type, transmission, and age of the car.

Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Checked for missing values (none found).
Encoded categorical variables such as "Fuel_Type," "Seller_Type," and "Transmission" into numerical values.
Feature Engineering:

Converted the "Year" column to calculate the age of each car.
Updated the dataset by adding the "Age" column and dropping the "Year" column.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y).
Further split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
Model Training:

Utilized the Linear Regression model from the scikit-learn library.
Fitted the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance on both the training and test datasets.
Calculated the R-squared error to measure how well the model fits the data.
Visualization:

Plotted scatter plots to compare actual prices with predicted prices for both training and test datasets.
Conclusion:

The Linear Regression model demonstrated good performance, as indicated by the R-squared scores. The scatter plots visually represent the closeness of predicted and actual prices. This project serves as a practical example of using machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on relevant features.
